USER INTERFACE
create a main manu

1. Login as Admin

	- create shelter
	- print

2. Login as Client
	- register new pets (create animals and add immidiately to client)
	- apply to a shelter 
		how to do handle it? I can be client of more than one shelter?
		now client is attribute to shelter so if a client can register in more than one shelter it will be duplicated
		maybe in shelder I should only have an array with client the index?

	- adopt an animal
	- give pet up to adoption

3. New Client Registration
	- create new client



CHANGES IN CODE

animal and client should be array and not hashes.
how?
- add the attribute .name
- when look for client/animals check the name and take the index of array
- in case of multiple client/animal ask for which one to choose.
